# Monorepo RPG manager

I've started making rpg manager with CodeIgniter 4 ðŸ”¥ backend and Astro ðŸš€ on frontend, but there are some thing, that I prefer to test before production. Astro ðŸš€ is focused on MPA, and I'm trying to make SPA, but valid for SEO and with simple HTML output for apache server. I'm playing around with Next SSG config, GatsbyJS, and here - I'm trying monorepo attempt with Remix.
