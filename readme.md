# Monorepo RPG manager

I've started making rpg manager with CodeIgniter 4 ðŸ”¥ backend and Astro ðŸš€ on frontend, but there are some thing, that I prefer to test before production. Astro ðŸš€ is focused on MPA, and I'm trying to make SPA, but valid for SEO and with simple HTML output for apache server. I'm playing around with Next SSG config, GatsbyJS, and here - I'm trying monorepo attempt with ~~Remix~~.

## Back to react âš›

Ok, so SEO aspects are going to trash. At least for now. I could achieve everything I want to achievie with NextJS or Remix, but the hosting will be a little more expensive than simple Apache. So, for now, I'm going back to classic React App âš›. But, becouse I'm using Monorepo, maybe someday, I could simply rebuild only the single package with views, becouse the components will still be there, ready to use.
